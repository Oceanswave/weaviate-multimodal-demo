# Weviate Multimodal Demo

A rewritten frontend for Weaviate's clip-multi-modal-text-image-search example that utilizes NextJS and tailwind.

The functionality is improved to also allow for searching by image.


GraphQL-Codegen is used to generate types for the GraphQL queries against the schema in Weaviate instead of the weviate-ts-client.
