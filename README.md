# Weviate Multimodal Demo

A rewritten frontend for Weaviate's clip-multi-modal-text-image-search example that utilizes NextJS, Typescript, and tailwind.

The functionality is also improved to also allow for searching by image.


GraphQL-Codegen is used to generate types for the GraphQL queries against the Weaviate schema instead of the weviate-ts-client.


Follow the instructions in Weviate's clip-multi-modal-text-image-search demo to create the necessary schema with your own data.
